              Okinawa is the southernmost prefecture of Japan.
              It consists of numerous islands in a chain of more than 1,000 kilometers and was known as the Ryukyu
              Kingdom
              from the 15th to the 19th century.
              Okinawa is a blend of different cultures from neighboring Asian areas. Okinawa is home to incredible sites
              recognized as both <a target="_blank"
                href="https://visitokinawajapan.com/discover/world-heritage-top/">Cultural and Natural World Heritage by
                UNESCO</a>.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">Okinawa Main Island (沖縄本島 Okinawa-hontō) is the largest of the Okinawa Islands and the
              Ryukyu (Nansei) Islands of Japan. The island is approximately 70 miles (110 km) long and an average 7
              miles (11 km) wide. There are 26 cities including Naha which is the prefectoral capital of Okinawa
              prefecture.</p>

            <p class="lead">Public transportation on Okinawa Honto is limited to buses, with the exception of the
              Okinawa Monorail in central Naha. The bus network is quite dense, but finding the right connections can be
              complicated.</p>

              <h2>Getting to Naha Airport (OKA)</h2>
            </div>
            <p class="lead">
              There are many domestic flights from main cities in Japan and direct international flights from China,
              Korea, and Singapore.</p>

            <p class="lead">If you plan to transit via Tokyo, we recommend to use Haneda Airport (HND). From Haneda,
              there are more than 20 flights per day to Okinawa. From Narita, instead, there are very few flights to
              Okinawa and you might need to transfer to Haneda by train. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e7116.html">Here</a> you can find more information on how to travel from Tokyo to Okinawa and around. </p>

                Sea-Park Hotel
                Tancha-Bay</a>. We highly recommend to use "Okinawa Airport Shuttle" to reach the hotel (80 minutes,
              1,400 JPY). To purchase the bus ticket, please refer to <a class="page-scroll" href="#section-bus">this
                section</a></li>. If you prefer to use a cab, the cost is about JPY 10,000.</p>

              There are many popular <a target="_blank" href="https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e7101.html">tourist attractions</a> around the city center of Naha. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e7118.html">Here</a> you can find a guide on how to get around Naha.</p>
            <p class="lead"><b><a target="_blank"
              href="https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e7114.html">Kokusaidori Street</a></b> (国際通り, Kokusaidōri, literally "International Road") is Naha's main
              street,
              stretching for roughly two kilometers through downtown Naha.
              Starting around the Prefectural Hall, Kokusaidori is lined by restaurants, cafes, bars, hotels, souvenir
              shops, boutiques and department stores. Many shops remain open until 10 PM, and live Okinawa music is
              played at several restaurants.
            <p class="lead"><b><a target="_blank" href="https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e7115.html">Tsuboya Pottery District</a></b> (Tsuboya Yachimun Street) Yachimun is an Okinawan dialect meaning
              pottery.
              It is a popular tourist destination with many small pottery studios selling traditional colorful tableware
              and shisa ornaments unique to Ryukyuan culture. Around the area, you can see the scenery of old Okinawa,
              with traditional Okinawan houses still remaining.

                  Castle)</a></b>. Shuri is the name of the former capital of the Ryukyu Kingdom. Shuri Castle (首里城,
              Shurijō) served as the
              administrative center and residence of the Ryukyu kings for several centuries until Okinawa became a
              Japanese prefecture in 1879. Shuri Castle was originally built in the late 1300s, and played an integral
              role in the political unification of the island. Unfortunately, a fire in October 2019 destroyed a total
              of nine facilities, including the main, south, and north halls. The restoration of the main hall is
              currently underway and is scheduled to be completed in 2026. Discover more <a target="_blank"
