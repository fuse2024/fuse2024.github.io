              Okinawa is the southernmost prefecture of Japan.
              It consists of numerous islands in a chain of more than 1,000 kilometers and was known as the Ryukyu
              Kingdom
              from the 15th to the 19th century.
              Okinawa is a blend of different cultures from neighboring Asian areas. Okinawa is home to incredible sites
              recognized as both <a target="_blank"
                href="https://visitokinawajapan.com/discover/world-heritage-top/">Cultural and Natural World Heritage by
                UNESCO</a>.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">Okinawa Main Island (Ê≤ñÁ∏ÑÊú¨Â≥∂ Okinawa-hont≈ç) is the largest of the Okinawa Islands and the
              Ryukyu (Nansei) Islands of Japan. The island is approximately 70 miles (110 km) long and an average 7
              miles (11 km) wide. There are 26 cities including Naha which is the prefectoral capital of Okinawa
              prefecture.</p>

            <p class="lead">Public transportation on Okinawa Honto is limited to buses, with the exception of the
              Okinawa Monorail in central Naha. The bus network is quite dense, but finding the right connections can be
              complicated.</p>

              <h2>Getting to Naha Airport (OKA)</h2>
            </div>
            <p class="lead">
              There are many domestic flights from main cities in Japan and direct international flights from China,
              Korea, and Singapore.</p>

            <p class="lead">If you plan to transit via Tokyo, we recommend to use Haneda Airport (HND). From Haneda,
              there are more than 20 flights per day to Okinawa. From Narita, instead, there are very few flights to
              Okinawa and you might need to transfer to Haneda by train. <a target="_blank"

              role in the political unification of the island. Unfortunately, a fire in October 2019 destroyed a total
              of nine facilities, including the main, south, and north halls. The restoration of the main hall is

              Mid June in Okinawa is the beginning of summer. Our accommodation has private beach and both indoor and
              outdoor pools. We also plan to go a small island during excursion. You must bring beach wear. Although you
              can
              find shops around the hotel and excursion site for beach wear and snorkeling gear, those are expensive but
              poor quality. I recommend you to bring snorkeling gear if you have.
            </p>

            <p class="lead">
              I also highly recommend you to prepare a flip-flap and a long-sleeved T-shirt or rash guard to protect you
              from strong UV and dangerous marine creatures.

            </div>
            <p class="lead">
              Most private beaches are guarded by anti-jellyfish barrier nets, so you don't need to be nervous for the
              dangerous sea creatures. However, it's always a good idea to watch out for the dangerous marine creatures
              listed in <a target="_blank"

            </p>

            <p class="lead">
              As a rule of thumb, if you see any of the three venomous sea creatures listed below, keep away from them.
              Please note that the <a target="_blank"
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portuguese_man_o%27_war">Portuguese man o' war (Physalia
                physalis)</a> can also be found washed out on sandy beaches in Japan. It looks like a beautiful blue
              glass, but it can still sting! The tentacles of beached or dying jellies can release venom for up to 2
              weeks. Do not touch it.
