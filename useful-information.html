              Okinawa is the southernmost prefecture of Japan.
              It consists of numerous islands in a chain of more than 1,000 kilometers and was known as the Ryukyu
              Kingdom
              from the 15th to the 19th century.
              Okinawa is a blend of different cultures from neighboring Asian areas. Okinawa is home to incredible sites
              recognized as both <a target="_blank"
                href="https://visitokinawajapan.com/discover/world-heritage-top/">Cultural and Natural World Heritage by
                UNESCO</a>.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">Okinawa Main Island (Ê≤ñÁ∏ÑÊú¨Â≥∂ Okinawa-hont≈ç) is the largest of the Okinawa Islands and the
              Ryukyu (Nansei) Islands of Japan. The island is approximately 70 miles (110 km) long and an average 7
              miles (11 km) wide. There are 26 cities including Naha which is the prefectoral capital of Okinawa
              prefecture.</p>

            <p class="lead">Public transportation in Okinawa-hont≈ç is limited to buses, with the exception of the
              Okinawa Monorail in central Naha. The bus network is quite dense, but finding the right connections can be
              complicated.</p>

              <h2>Getting to Naha Airport (OKA)</h2>

              There are many domestic flights from main cities in Japan and direct international flights from China,
              Korea, and Singapore.</p>

            <p class="lead">If you plan to transit via Tokyo, we recommend to use Haneda Airport (HND). From Haneda,
              there are more than 20 flights per day to Okinawa. From Narita, instead, there are very few flights to
              Okinawa and you might need to transfer to Haneda by train. <a target="_blank"

              role in the political unification of the island. Unfortunately, a fire in October 2019 destroyed a total
              of nine facilities, including the main, south, and north halls. The restoration of the main hall is

              Mid June in Okinawa is the beginning of summer. Our accommodation has private beach and both indoor and
              outdoor pools. During our excursion, we plan to visit a small island. It is strongly recommended to bring
              your own beachwear and snorkeling gear (if you have). Although you
              can
              find shops selling beachwear and snorkeling gear around the hotel and excursion site, those are expensive
              and of poor quality. Please also pack your flip-flops and a long-sleeved t-shirt (or rash guard) to
              protect you
              from strong UV and dangerous sea creatures.

              Most private beaches are guarded by anti-jellyfish barrier nets, so you can relax. However, it's always a

              As a rule of thumb, if you see any of the three venomous sea creatures listed below, keep away from them.

              glass, but it can still sting! The tentacles of beached or dying jellies can release venom for up to 2
              weeks. Do not touch it.
